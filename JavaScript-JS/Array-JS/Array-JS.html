        Why Array is used?
        It is used because if there are 100 values we have to create 100 
        variables, so to avoid this, with the help of Array which can be 
        created only with one variable but can store many values....
        */

        Array had two main Parts:-
        1. Index
        2. Value
        */
        // Way to display Array
        students = ["Shreya", "Sony", "Gouri", "Sweety"];
        // Printing array with the help of console.log
        console.log(students);
        // Printing array in Tabular Format with the help of con sole.table
        console.table(students);
        // Finding no of elements in the array...
        console.log(students.length);
        // Getting particular element with the help of index number
        // Index number starts from 0...
        console.log(students[2])
        // students of 2 -->Read as
        // Updating value at index no. 0 as "Padma"
        students[0] = "Padma";
        console.table(students);
        // Adding an Element to the Array...
        students[4] = "Vinod";
        console.table(students);
        /* 
        But if an element is added leaving one index place...
        Then that place is named as "empty"...
        This "empty" word will not be displayed with the help of console.table
        It will just show the index numeber updated... Not the "empty" word.
