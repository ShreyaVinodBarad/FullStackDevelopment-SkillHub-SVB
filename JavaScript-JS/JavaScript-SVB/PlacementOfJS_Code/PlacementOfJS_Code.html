        There is a flexibility given to include JavaScript code anywhere 
        in an HTML document. However the most preferred ways to include 
        JavaScript in an HTML file are as follows:
        - Method - 1
        Script in <head>...</head> section.
        - Method - 2 
        Script in <body>...</body> section.
        - Method - 3 
        Script in <body>...</body> and <head>...</head> sections.
        - Method - 4 
        Script in an external file and then include in <head>...</head> 
        section.
