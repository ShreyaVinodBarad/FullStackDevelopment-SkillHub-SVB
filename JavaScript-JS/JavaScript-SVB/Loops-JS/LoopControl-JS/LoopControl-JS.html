        /*
        => Loop Control in JavaScript:-
        - JavaScript provides full control to handle loops and switch statements. There 
        may be a situation when you need to come out of a loop without reaching at its 
        bottom. There may also be a situation when you want to skip a part of your code 
        block and start the next iteration of the look.
        - To handle all such situations, JavaScript provides break and continue
        statements. These statements are used to immediately come out of any loop or 
        to start the next iteration of any loop respectively.
                                    LOOP CONTROL
                                         |_ 1) break;
                                         |_ 2) continue;
