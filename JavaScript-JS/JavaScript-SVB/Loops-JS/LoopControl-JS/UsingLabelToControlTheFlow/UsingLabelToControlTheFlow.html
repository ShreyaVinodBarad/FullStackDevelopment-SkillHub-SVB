        /*
        - Labels are used to associate them with expressions.
        - Use the Label to refer to the expression.
        -The Label Statement is used with the break and continue statements and serves 
        to identify the statement to which the break and continue statements apply.
        - Usage
        Without the use of a labeled statement the break statement can only break out of 
        a loop or a switch statement. Using a labeled statement allows break to jump out 
        of any code block.
        - When used with a continue statement the labeled statement allows you to skip a 
        loop iteration, the advantage comes from being able to jump out from an inner 
        loop to an outer one when you have nested loop statements. Without the use of a 
        labeled statement you could only jump out of the existing loop iteration to the 
        next iteration of the same loop.
        - Syntax:-
        -----------------
        | label name:   |   
        | expression    |
        -----------------
        - Jacascript labels can only be used with break and continue statements within 
        loops or functions.
        - Example:-
        */
