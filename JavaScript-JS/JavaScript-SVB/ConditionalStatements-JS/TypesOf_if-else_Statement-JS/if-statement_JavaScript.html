        - Conditional Statement in JavaScript:-
        1) if Statement in JavaScript:-
        The ‘if’ statement is the fundamental control statement that allows JavaScript 
        to make decisions and execute statements conditionally.
        - Syntax"-
        The syntax for a basic if statement is as follows:
        ---------------------------------------------------------
        |if (expression)                                        |
        |{                                                      |
        |   Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true   |
        |}                                                      |
        |                                                       |
        ---------------------------------------------------------
        - Here a JavaScript expression is evaluated. If the resulting value is true, the
          given statement(s) are executed. 
                            If the expression is false, then no statement would be not 
          executed. Most of the times, you will use comparison operators while making 
          decisions.
        - Example:-
        */
        let age = 19;
        if(age < 18)
        {
            console.log("Minor");
        }
