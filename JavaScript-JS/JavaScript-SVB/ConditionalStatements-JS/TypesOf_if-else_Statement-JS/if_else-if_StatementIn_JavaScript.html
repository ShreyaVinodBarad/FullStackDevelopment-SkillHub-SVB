        - There is nothing special about this code. It is just a series of if statements, 
        where each if is a part of the else clause of the previous statement. 
        - Statement(s) are executed based on the true condition, if none of the 
        conditions is true, then the else block is executed.
        - Example:-
        */
        let Book = "History"
        if(Book === "Science")
        {
            console.log("It's Science Book!")
        }
        else if(Book === "Maths")
        {
            console.log("It's Maths Book!")
        }
        else if(Book === "History")
        {
            console.log("It's History Book!")
        }
        else
        {
            console.log("Unkown Book!")
        }
