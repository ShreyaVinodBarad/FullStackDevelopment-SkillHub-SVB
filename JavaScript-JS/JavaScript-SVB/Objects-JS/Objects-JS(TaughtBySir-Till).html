    * What are Objects in JavaScript?
    - In JavaScript, objects are a fundamental data type that allow you to store 
    collections of data and more complex entities. Objects can be seen as a 
    collection of properties, where each property is a key-value pair.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Key Concepts of Objects in JavaScript:-
    - Properties:
    1) Properties are the values associated with an object.
    2) A property can be a variable (e.g., a number, string, boolean) or another 
    object.
    3) Properties are identified by a key (or name), which is a string.
    - Methods:
    1) When a property of an object is a function, it is called a method.
    2) Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
    - Key-Value Pairs:
    1) An object is a set of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or Symbols) 
    and values can be any data type, including other objects.
    - Dynamic Nature:
    1) JavaScript objects are dynamic, meaning you can add, change, or delete 
    properties after the object is created.
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Note:-
    - JavaScript is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language. A programming 
    language can be called object-oriented if it provides four basic capabilities 
    to developers:
    1) Encapsulation: 
    - the capability to store related information, whether data or methods, 
    together in an object.
    2) Aggregation: 
    - the capability to store one object inside another object.
    3) Inheritance: 
    - the capability of a class to rely upon another class (or number of classes) 
    for some of its properties and methods.
    4) Polymorphism: 
    - the capability to write one function or method that works in a variety of 
    different ways.
    > Objects are composed of attributes. If an attribute contains a function, it 
    is considered to be a method of the object, otherwise the attribute is 
    considered a property.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * Object Properties:-
    - In JavaScript, object properties are the fundamental units that store data 
    in an object. Each property consists of a key (also known as a name) and a 
    value.
    # Object Properties
    1) Key: A string (or Symbol) that identifies the property within the object.
    2) Value: Any valid JavaScript data type (string, number, array, function, 
    another object, etc.) that is associated with the key.
    # Syntax:-
    1) Using Object Literal Notation:-
    const objectName = 
    {
    propertyName: propertyValue,
    // or
        propertyName: function() 
        {
            // function body
        }
    };
    # Example:-
    -->
    <script>
        const car = 
        {
            Make: "Toyota",
            Model: "Corolla",
            Year: 2020,
            Start: function()
            {
                console.log("Car Started");
            }
        };
        console.log(car.Make)
        console.log(car.Model)
        console.log(car["Year"])
        car.Start()
    </script>
    <!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <!--  
    # Adding, Modifying, and Deleting Properties:-
    1) Adding Properties
    -You can add new properties to an existing object.
    - Example:-
    -->
    <script>
        const StuDetails = 
        {
            Name : "Shreya Vinod Barad"
        }
        StuDetails.Age = 21
        console.log(StuDetails.Age)
    </script>
    <!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <!--  
    2) Modifying Properties:-
    - You can modify existing properties.
    - Example:-
    -->
    <script>
        const StuDetails1 = 
        {
            Name : "Shreya Vinod Barad"
        }
        StuDetails1.Name = "Gouri Vinod Barad"
        console.log(StuDetails1.Name)
    </script>
    <!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <!--  
    3) Deleting Properties:-
    - To remove a property from an object, use the delete operator.
    - Example:-
    -->
    <script>
        const StuDetails2 = 
        {
            Name : "Shreya Vinod Barad"
        }
        StuDetails2.Name = "Gouri Vinod Barad"
        delete StuDetails2.Name
        console.log(StuDetails2.Name)
    </script>
    <!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <!--  
    4) Checking for Properties:-
    - You can check if a property exists in an object using the in operator or 
    hasOwnProperty method.
    - Example:-
    -->
    <script>
        const StuDetails3 = 
        {
            Name : "Shreya Vinod Barad"
        }
        console.log("Name" in StuDetails3)
        console.log(StuDetails3.hasOwnProperty("Name"))
    </script>
    <!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
    <!--  
    5) Iterating Over Properties:- 
    - To iterate over an object's properties, you can use a for...in loop.
    - Example:-
    -->
    <script>
        const StuDetails4 = 
        {
            Name : "Shreya Vinod Barad",
            Age : 21,
            Qualification: "Graduate"
        }
        for(let item in StuDetails4)
        {
            if(StuDetails4.hasOwnProperty(item))
            {
                console.log(`${item} - ${StuDetails4[item]}`)
            }
        }
        /*
        1) hasOwnProperty:-
        In a for...in loop, hasOwnProperty is used to filter out inherited 
        properties, ensuring that only the object's own properties are processed.
        */ 
    </script>
