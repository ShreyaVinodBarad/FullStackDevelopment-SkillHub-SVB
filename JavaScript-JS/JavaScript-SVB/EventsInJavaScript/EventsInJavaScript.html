    * Events in JavaScript:-
    # Explanation:-
    - JavaScript events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, 
    and you can respond to them using JavaScript. These events are essential 
    for creating interactive web pages, allowing you to execute code in 
    response to user actions like clicks, key presses, or page loads.
    # What Are Events?
    - Events are things that happen on a web page. They can be triggered by the 
    user, the browser, or the web page itself. For example:
    1) User Events: Clicking a button, typing in a text field, or moving the 
    mouse.
    2) Browser Events: Loading a page, resizing a window, or closing a tab.
    3) Page Events: Video starts playing, image fails to load, or form 
    submission.
    # Common Types of Events
    1) Mouse Events
    - click: Triggered when a user clicks on an element.
    - dblclick: Triggered when a user double-clicks an element.
    - mouseover: Triggered when a user moves the mouse over an element.
    - mouseout: Triggered when a user moves the mouse away from an element.
    2) Keyboard Events
    - keydown: Triggered when a key is pressed down.
    - keyup: Triggered when a key is released.
    - keypress: Triggered when a key is pressed (captures character keys).
    3) Form Events
    - submit: Triggered when a form is submitted.
    - change: Triggered when the value of an input element changes.
    - focus: Triggered when an element gains focus (like when clicking into a 
    text field).
    - blur: Triggered when an element loses focus.
    4) Window Events
    - load: Triggered when the whole page has loaded.
    - resize: Triggered when the browser window is resized.
    - scroll: Triggered when the page is scrolled.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1) Mouse Events - "onclick":-
    - The onclick event is a mouse event in web development that is triggered 
    when a user clicks on an element. This event can be used to execute a 
    script or function when the user clicks on an HTML element, such as a 
    button, link, image, or any other HTML element that supports user 
    interaction.
    # How onclick Works
    - HTML Element: The onclick event can be added directly to an HTML element. 
    When the element is clicked, the specified JavaScript code is executed.
    - JavaScript Function: You can also define a separate JavaScript function 
    and link it to the onclick event.
    # Example:-
    -->
    <button onclick="Example_EventsIn_JS()">
        Click Me
    </button>
    <script>
        function Example_EventsIn_JS()
        {
            document.write("<h1 style = 'color: red'>Hello! Thanks for Clicking the Button!</h1>")
        }
    </script>
    <!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
    <!--  
    2) onsubmit Event Type:-
    # Explanation:-
    - The onsubmit event in JavaScript is an event handler that is triggered 
    when a form is submitted. This event allows you to run custom JavaScript 
    code when a user submits a form, making it a useful tool for form validation, 
    data processing, or preventing the default form submission behavior.
    # Basic Usage:-
    - The onsubmit event can be attached to a <form> element. When the user 
    attempts to submit the form, the onsubmit event is fired.
    # Eaxample:- 
    -->
    <script>
        function Submit()
        {
            const NameOfPerson = document.forms["myForm"]["Name"].value
            if(NameOfPerson === "")
            {
                alert("This field is Mandatory!")
                return false;
            } 
            return true;
        }
    </script>
    <form  name = "myForm" onsubmit="return Submit()">
        Name: <input type="text" name = "Name" id="Name">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit my Name....">
    </form>
    <!--
    ðŸ‘† Explanation:-
    # HTML Structure:
    1) Form Element: 
    The <form> element has an onsubmit attribute that is set to call the 
    validateForm() function.
    2) Input Field: There is a single text input field for the username, 
    which the user must fill in before submitting the form.
    3) Submit Button: The form has a submit button that triggers the form 
    submission process.  
    ============================================================================
    # JavaScript Validation:
    1) Function validateForm(): 
    This function is executed when the form is submitted.
    2) Access Input Value: 
    The value of the input field with the name username is retrieved using 
    document.forms["myForm"]["username"].value.
    3) Check for Empty Value: If the input field is empty, an alert is shown to 
    the user, and return false; is executed to prevent the form from being 
    submitted.
    4) Allow Submission: If the input field is not empty, return true; is 
    executed, allowing the form to be submitted.

    3) onMouseOut & onMouseIn / onMouseOver Events in JavaScript:-
    - In JavaScript, the onMouseOut and onMouseOver (or onMouseIn) events are 
    used to detect when the mouse pointer leaves or enters an HTML element, 
    respectively. These events can be used to create interactive and dynamic 
    web applications by responding to user actions with various effects like 
    changing styles, displaying tooltips, or triggering animations.
    1) onMouseOver / onMouseIn Event:-
    - The onMouseOver event is triggered when the mouse pointer enters the 
    boundary of an element. This event can be used to perform actions like 
    highlighting an element, showing a tooltip, or changing an image.
    2) onMouseOut Event:-
    - The onMouseOut event is triggered when the mouse pointer leaves the 
    boundary of an element. This event can be useful for reversing any changes 
    made during the onMouseOver event or performing clean-up actions like hiding 
    a tooltip.
    ==> Example for both onMouseOver and onMouseOut:-    
    -->
    <div class="Text" onmouseover="onMouseOver()" onmouseout="onMouseOut()">
        Let's see an Example of onMoueOver and onMouseOut Events in JavaScript!
    </div>
    <style>
        .Text
        {
            color:chocolate;
        }
        .Text:hover
        {
            color:brown;
        }
    </style>
    <script>
        function onMouseOver()
        {
            console.log("It's onMouseOver Event!")
        }
        function onMouseOut()
        {
            console.log("It's onMouseOut Event!")
        }
    </script>
    <!--  
    # Explanation:-ðŸ‘†
    - HTML: 
    A div element with the class hover-box has both onmouseover and onmouseout 
    event attributes.
    - CSS: The hover-box has a background color that changes when hovered over.
    - JavaScript: The mouseOver and mouseOut functions log messages to the 
    console when the mouse enters or leaves the element, respectively.
