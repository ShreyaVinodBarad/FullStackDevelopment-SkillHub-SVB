        Swapping of Variable's Value:-
        consider 2 Variables with name x and y;
        Then there values are assigned as :
        let x = 10;
        let y = 20;
        Now our task is to Swap the Values...
        Then get the Ans:-
        x = 20;
        y = 10;
        */ 
        let x = 10;
        let y = 20;
        let dummy;
        console.log(x, y)
        // 1. Method - 1
        dummy = x;
        x = y;
        y = dummy;
        console.log(x, y)
        // 2. Method - 2
        // Method - 2 is only applicable on Numbers!
        x = x + y;
        y = x - y;
        x = x - y;
        console.log(x, y)
        // Method - 3
        // Using Array
        const arr = [x, y]
        x = arr[1]
        y = arr[0]
        console.log(x, y)
