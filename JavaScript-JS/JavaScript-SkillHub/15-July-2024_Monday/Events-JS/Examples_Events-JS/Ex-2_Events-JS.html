            Here below it can be seen that the "typeof" Operator gives output as String.
            Because every time we take some data from HTML to JS it comes in the String 
            Format.
            So, here the the output for the "typeof(x)" and "typeof(y)" will be "string".
            So, if number are added then it will "concatenate" it but will not add...
            Eg:-
            2 
            2
            On clicking on button in the console you will get output as:-
            22
            */ 
            let x = Num1.value
            let y = Num2.value
            console.log(typeof(x))
            console.log(typeof(y))
            console.log(x + y)
            /*
            So to make it in the "number" format so that addition can be performed then
            we have to add "+" symbol at the starting of the name of the "id".
            Here is the code for that, 
            */ 
            let a = +Num1.value
            let b = +Num2.value

            console.log(typeof(b))
            console.log(a + b)
