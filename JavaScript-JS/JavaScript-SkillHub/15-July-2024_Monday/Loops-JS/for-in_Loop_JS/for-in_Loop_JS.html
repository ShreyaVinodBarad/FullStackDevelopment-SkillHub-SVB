        So, now using "for - in" loop for Objects...

        If we are assigning a variable named x = "city", then when giving test.x = "Pune"
        then it will not add value of x i.e. "city" as the next key but it will add "x" as the 
        key.
        So, to get the "city" as key for variable x we have to use "Dynamic Key Method".
        That is, keeping the variable which contains the name for the key you want to add, into 
        square brackets i.e.: test[x]  = "Pune".
        Then here we will get "city: 'Pune'" in the test - Object.
        Example:-
        */
        x = "city"
        test.x = "Pune"
        console.log(test)
        /*
        For the above code it will not add "city" as the key but will add "x" as the key and 
        will print the value as "x = 'Pune'".
        */ 
        /*
        If you want to get "city" as your key which you have stored in variable "x", we have to 
        use "Dynamic Key Method".
        Wherein we assign the vaiable which contains the key name, in "Square Brackets - []" and then 
        will give that expression a value which will be the value for the Key.
        Example:-
        */ 
        test[x] = "Pune"
        console.log(test)
