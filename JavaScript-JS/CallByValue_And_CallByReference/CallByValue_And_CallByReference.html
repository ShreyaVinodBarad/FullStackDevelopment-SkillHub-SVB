        in category of "strict equal to", though the values of both the array
        are same.
        - In array values are not compared but there addresses are taken into 
        consideration.That's way if p has address as 124, then it is assigned to 
        q, so it's address will also be 124.
        so as array follows the conspect of "Call by Reference" wherein if values
        are equal in both the array's, then also they are not same because 
        in array values are not compared but actually there address are taken 
        into consideration.

        is given to i,so i and r now has same address wherein the array is stored. 
        when we push a value then, the value added will be in the same "Address".
        so it will give [10] in both the i  and r variable.
